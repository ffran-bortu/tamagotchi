# Quick Deploy to Vercel

## Step 1: Deploy Your App

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
vercel
```

**What will happen:**
1. First time: It will ask you to log in
   - Press Enter to open browser
   - Sign up/login with GitHub, Google, or email (free)
   - Come back to terminal when done

2. It will ask questions:
   - **Set up and deploy?** → Press Enter (Yes)
   - **Which scope?** → Press Enter (your account)
   - **Link to existing project?** → Press N (No)
   - **Project name?** → Press Enter (or type a name)
   - **Directory?** → Press Enter (use current folder)
   - **Override settings?** → Press N (No)

3. **Wait for deployment** (30-60 seconds)

4. **You'll get a URL like:** `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

## Step 2: Use PWA Builder

1. Copy the URL Vercel gave you
2. Go to: https://www.pwabuilder.com/
3. Paste the URL
4. Click "Start"
5. Follow the PWA Builder steps to create APK

## That's It!

Your app is now online and ready for PWA Builder!

## Note

- Vercel is free for personal projects
- Your app will be publicly accessible (but that's fine - it's just a local journal app)
- You can delete the deployment anytime from vercel.com
